# Lighthouse for Azure Pipelines

This is an Azure DevOps extension that allows you to enhance your Azure Pipelines with a new Lighthouse tab.
The Lighthouse tab embed the HTML report generated by [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).

The extension comes with a task that requires:

- The URL of the website to analyse,
- The npm package [lighthouse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lighthouse) installed on your agent, either locally or globally.

The task also allows you to specify audit rules that can make the pipeline fail based on the audit scores.

For example, the Google Lighthouse audit `no-vulnerable-libraries` has a boolean score that will be equal to 0 if there are known vulnerabilities within client-side JavaScript libraries and frameworks detected on a web site.
In order to make the pipeline fail if this audit score is not equal to 1, you can type:

```
no-vulnerable-libraries = 1
```

You can also use the `>` (greater than) operator to evaluate audit scores that are decimal between 0 and 1.
